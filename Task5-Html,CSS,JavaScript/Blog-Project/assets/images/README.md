# Blog Project

This is a simple blog project built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It features a homepage displaying recent posts, a detailed post page with comments, and a responsive design for mobile devices.

## Features

- **Homepage**: Displays a featured post and a grid of recent posts.
- **Post Page**: Shows the full content of a post along with a comments section.
- **Responsive Design**: Optimized for both desktop and mobile devices.
- **Dynamic Content**: Posts and comments are loaded dynamically using JavaScript.

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository or download the project files.
2. Open `index.html` in your browser to view the homepage.
3. Click on a post to navigate to the post page (`post.html`).
4. Add comments on the post page using the comment form.

## Development

### Prerequisites

- A modern web browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, Edge).
- A local server (optional, for loading JSON files).

### Running the Project

1. Open the project folder in your code editor (e.g., Visual Studio Code).
2. Use a local server to serve the files (e.g., [Live Server](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer) extension for VS Code).
3. Navigate to `index.html` in your browser.

### Customization

- **Posts Data**: Update `assets/post.json` with your own posts.
- **Styles**: Modify `assets/style.css` to customize the design.
- **Scripts**: Update `assets/main.js` and `assets/post.js` for additional functionality.

## Known Issues

- The `post.json` file is currently a placeholder and should be replaced with a real API or database in production.
- Comments are not persisted and will reset on page reload.
